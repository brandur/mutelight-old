== Mutelight

This is source that builds my blog at "mutelight.org":http://mutelight.org. It compiles with:

* "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll &mdash; to build HTML pages by combining layouts with textile documents
* "Less":http://lesscss.org/ &mdash; to build a working CSS file from the included @.less@ file
