h1. Mutelight

This is source that builds my blog at "mutelight.org":http://mutelight.org. It compiles with:

* "nanoc":http://nanoc.stoneship.org/ &mdash; to build HTML pages applying filter and combining layouts with site items
* "Pygments":http://pygments.org/ &mdash; a Python syntax highlighter that supports a lot of different languages

Built with heavy influence from mgutz's minimalist nanoc3 blog.
