If you listen to a lot of rock on the radio, you may have noticed by now that Blur's <em>Song 2</em> has consistently been a big winner for years, outlasting the vast majority of other popular songs. <em>Song 2</em> is good, upbeat, and people like it, making it a perfect song for the radio.

What do our friendly radio stations <em>really</em> like about <em>Song 2</em> though? Well, it's short. Clocking in at a mere 1:58, the stations can get some music out of the way before getting back to what they really enjoy: commercials, radio personalities reiterating day old stories that they found on Digg, and more commercials.
